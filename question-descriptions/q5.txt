Question 5 - Share Exchange Problem
Task
Some trading occurs in blocks, where an entire 'chunk' of shares is obtained in one go. This question concentrates on allocations, where this block is being split in such a way to maximize the profit.
You are working with the trading team in this scenario and they have asked you to design an algorithm, which takes in an array of allowed allocations for shares and a total value of shares that you need to obtain.
Your algorithm should return the smallest possible number of allocations for this exchange to take place in order to avoid any overhead and maximize the speed of the transactions.
Constraints
You can assume that in a given set of potential allocations there is at least one way of completing a full allocation.
You can not make any assumptions about ordering of available allocations.
Examples
Example 1
input: [1, 3, 4], 6 output: 2

Do it by picking 3 and 3 as your minimal split, despite the fact that there are other possible solutions that require more different allocations.
Example 2
input: [3, 4], 6 output: 2

There is only one way to complete an allocation in this scenario.
