Question 6 - Connect to Server with Shortest Route
Task
In finance, systems with low latencies are vital to the business. Thus, efficient data transfer algorithms need to be used.
Here at Credit Suisse, we have n servers, numbered as 0, 1, 2…, n-1; All nodes are connected to each other. However, due to the location and hardware constraints of the servers, the time span t for the data to reach one node from another could be very large. Therefore, you need to work out an algorithm that determines the shortest route between server 0 to any target server k, in order to save time.
Your output should return the time taken to reach the target server from server 0 in shortest route.
Constraints
You can assume that no negative weight is given for the route between the servers
Examples
Example 1
input: [3,1,[[0,7,4],[7,0,2],[4,2,0]] output: 6

For input, the first number tells you how many server there are and the second number is the target server. Then each row of the 2-D array represents the time taken to connect from that server to every other server. E.g. [0,7,4] shows the time for server 0 -> 0 = 0s, server 0 -> 1 = 7s, server 0 -> 2 = 4s. Hence the shortest path to get to server 1 from server 0 is 0->2->1 and the path adds up to 6s.
